"""Regression test: meetings must NOT be auto-concluded when team CC config
disappears while the meeting still has recent messages.

Root cause: _check_team_liveness in StateReaper immediately closed OS teams
(and cascaded to conclude all active meetings) when the CC team directory
was missing — without checking if meetings were still actively in use.

Fix: guard against closing teams that have active meetings with messages
newer than MEETING_EXPIRY_MINUTES.
